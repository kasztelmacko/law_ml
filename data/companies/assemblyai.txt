1.2Order Terms. This Order Form (“Order Form”) between Customer and AssemblyAI is hereby attached to and made part of the above TOS entered into between AssemblyAI and Customer. Capitalized terms not defined in this Order Form will have the meanings defined in the TOS. Unless otherwise stated in the TOS, in the event of a conflict between the terms of the TOS and those in this Order Form, the terms in this Order Form will control.

‍

1.3Services and Fees. AssemblyAI shall make the Platform and Support Services available to Customer throughout the Term (as defined in Section 2). In exchange, as of the Order Start Date, Customer agrees to pay AssemblyAI fees (“Fees”) based on Customer’s actual utilization of Services (“PAYG Basis”) calculated at the rates detailed in the Appendix A Fee Schedule (“Fee Schedule”). AssemblyAI shall invoice Customer for such Fees as per the Invoice Schedule and Customer shall pay said invoices within the Payment Term. The Fee Schedule may be modified during the Service Term by mutual written agreement of the Parties (email will suffice).

‍

1.4Spend Commitment. If Customer has agreed to a non-zero Spend Commitment, any use by Customer of the Services will first be counted against the Spend Commitment balance, until such time as such Spend Commitment is satisfied. Customer will be invoiced per the Commit Schedule for the Spend Commitment over a one (1) year period, with each such invoice due within the Payment Term. If Customer depletes its Spend Commitment balance before the Spend Commitment amount is fully invoiced by AssemblyAI, the remaining amount will be accelerated and will be invoiced to Customer, with such invoice due within the Payment Term. At the end of the Service Term, any unused Spend Commitment will expire and will not roll over into a new Service Term.

‍
2.TERM

2.1Term. This Order Form term (“Term”) commences on the Order Start Date, and continues for the duration of the Service Term (“Initial Term”), unless terminated earlier. Treatment of renewal terms under this Order Form is subject to the TOS, unless otherwise herein provided. Upon termination or expiration of this Order Form, any unpaid remainder of the Spend Commitment, or other unpaid amounts owed for Services, will then become due in full and AssemblyAI shall invoice such remainder amount to Customer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where the Service Term is designated “Unfixed”, and there is a non-zero Spend Commitment, the term ends when AssemblyAI has provided Platform Services to Customer in a quantity equivalent to the Spend Commitment (“Commit Period”).

‍

2.2Term Renewals. If Renewal is designated “Not Automatic”, the term does not renew upon expiration or termination. If Renewal is designated “Automatic”:

‍

a. Where the Service Term is not “Unfixed”, at the expiration of the Initial term (“Initial Term”), the Order Form will automatically renew for subsequent terms matching the initial Term (each a “Renewal Term”). Either Party may opt out of automatic renewal by providing written notice to the other Party thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then-current term. Following receipt of a valid opt-out notification, the Order Form will end at the end of the term. Where there is a non-zero Spend Commitment, subject to this Section, upon Customer’s satisfying the Spend Commitment before the end of the term, Customer’s further use of Services for the duration of the remaining term will be invoiced on a PAYG Basis charged based on the Fee Schedule.

‍

b. Where the Service Term is designated "Unfixed", and a non-zero Spend Commitment, upon completion of the Initial Term Commit Period, the Order Form will automatically renew for subsequent terms matching the conditions of the Initial Term, including refreshing the Spend Commitment (each a “Renewal Term”). Each Party may provide written notice of non-renewal prior to the completion of a Commit Period. Following receipt of a valid opt-out notification, the Order Form will end at the end of the term.

‍

2.3Termination by Convenience. Either Party may terminate this Order Form for its convenience by providing written notice (email shall suffice). Such termination for convenience will be effective (i) thirty (30) days after receipt of Customer’s notice by AssemblyAI; or (ii) ninety (90) days after receipt of AssemblyAI’s notice by Customer.
