FOR CLARITY AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THESE TERMS OF USE, COHERE WILL NOT SHARE A CUSTOM MODEL WITH ANY THIRD PARTY BUT MAY SHARE FINETUNING DATA USED TO FINETUNE OR TRAIN A CUSTOM MODEL WITH THIRD PARTIES. THE TERM “API DATA” MEANS CUSTOMER DATA SUBMITTED BY YOU TO THE COHERE API.

Subscription Orders 

These Terms of Use will govern the placement of any order you make through the Cohere Solution for a subscription to the Services (each such order, a “Subscription Order”). We will confirm your request by sending an email to the email address you have provided. Your placement of a Subscription Order through the Cohere Solution is an offer to purchase the Services ordered, and we may accept your Subscription Order by providing a subscription agreement (the “Subscription Agreement”) for your acceptance and processing your payment through the Cohere Solution. Your receipt of an electronic or other form of Subscription Order confirmation does not signify our acceptance of your Subscription Order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell. For any reason, we may decline to accept your Subscription Order or any part of your Subscription Order. No Subscription Order will be considered accepted by Cohere until the applicable Subscription Agreement has been accepted by us and your payment has been processed. If (a) we decline to accept your Subscription Order, (b) one or more elements of your Subscription Order are unavailable, or (c) your Subscription Order cannot be fulfilled for any reason in our discretion, we will attempt to notify you as soon as practicable at the email address you provided. We may require additional verifications or information before considering any Subscription Order.

Payment

To pay for a Subscription Order as described in an accepted Subscription Agreement, you will need to provide Cohere or, if applicable, a third-party payment processor (the “Payment Processor”) with the information necessary to process payment from you, including the billing information requested on the Cohere Solution or the applicable Payment Processor’s platform. The processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor, if any, in addition to these Terms of Use. We are not responsible for any error by, or other acts or omissions of, any Payment Processor. You may pay for your Subscription Order via credit card or any other manner then available on the Cohere Solution or applicable Payment Processor’s platform. By submitting your payment information to us or the Payment Processor, you authorize us or the Payment Processor to charge the applicable payment method at our or their convenience (but within thirty (30) days of credit card authorization). You represent and warrant that you will not use any credit card or other form of payment unless you have all necessary authorization to do so. We assume that because Subscription Order payments require a valid credit card, only persons age 18 or over are placing Subscription Orders and providing us and/or the Payment Processor with the information requested during the payment process. We and/or the Payment Processor are not liable in the event your children or others acting with or without your permission use your credit card or other means of payment to make purchases on the Cohere Solution or the Payment Processor’s platform (and to the extent your minor children make any such purchases, you hereby represent and warrant that they are authorized to do so); however, you may report any unauthorized use to us or the Payment Processor, and we and/or the Payment Processor will use reasonable measures within our control to help prevent future unauthorized use of your card. We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes that any Payment Processor makes even if it has already requested or received payment. 

The terms of your payment will be based on your chosen payment provider and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen payment method. If we, either through the Payment Processor or otherwise, do not receive payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due on your billing account upon demand.

You must provide current, complete and accurate information for your billing account. You must promptly update all information to keep your billing account current, complete and accurate (such as a change in billing address, credit card number, or credit card expiration date), and you must promptly notify us if your payment method is cancelled (e.g., for loss or theft) or if you become aware of a potential breach of security, such as the unauthorized disclosure or use of your user name or password. Changes to such information can be made in your account settings. If you fail to provide any of the foregoing information, you agree that we may continue charging you for any use of paid services under your billing account unless you have terminated your paid services in accordance with any applicable Subscription Agreement.

If the amount to be charged to your billing account varies from the amount you preauthorized (other than due to the imposition or change in the amount of applicable sales taxes), you have the right to receive, and we will provide, notice of the amount to be charged and the date of the charge before the scheduled date of the transaction. Any agreement you have with your payment provider will govern your use of your payment method of choice. You agree that we may accumulate charges incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing cycle.

Pricing and Services

Subscription and Services options displayed on the Cohere Solution may be discontinued or unavailable for any other reason, and prices are subject to change. Except where otherwise indicated, all prices do not include any applicable sales taxes, which will be added to your total purchase price. You are responsible for the payment of any provincial and local sales or use taxes that may apply to your Subscription Order. We will provide you no less than seven (7) days’ notice prior to implementing a change to our prices.

Waiver. Our failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms of Use will not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. A waiver of any provision of these Terms of Use must be in writing and a waiver in one instance will not preclude enforcement of such provision on other occasions.

Severable. If any of the provisions contained in these Terms of Use are determined to be void, invalid or otherwise unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision will be severed from these Terms of Use and all other provisions of these Terms of Use will remain in full force and effect.
