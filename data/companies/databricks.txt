These terms of use (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of all Databricks-branded publicly available websites, including sites located on databricks.com (other than *.cloud.databricks.com and help.databricks.com), as well as spark-summit.org, and spark-packages.org and any other pages that link to these Terms (collectively, the “Sites”). These Terms expressly do not govern your access to or use of the Databricks Platform Services (known as Databricks and Databricks Community Edition, each located at *.cloud.databricks.com, or the related website at help.databricks.com and platform support services, together the “Platform Services”), which are subject to the Databricks Terms of Service (or with respect to the Community Edition, the Community Edition Terms of Service) or other written agreement in place between Databricks, Inc. (“Databricks”) and our subscribers (“Subscribers”) (any such agreement, a “Services Agreement”).

PLEASE READ CAREFULLY THESE TERMS AND THE DATABRICKS PRIVACY POLICY (“PRIVACY POLICY”) WHICH IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE INTO THESE TERMS. BY ACCESSING OR USING ANY OF THE SITES, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE AT LEAST 18 YEARS OLD, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD THESE TERMS, AND YOU AGREE TO BE LEGALLY BOUND BY ALL OF THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THESE TERMS, DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SITES. WE SUGGEST YOU PRINT A COPY OF THESE TERMS FOR YOUR RECORDS.

Throughout the Terms, “we,” “us,” “our” and “ours” refer to Databricks, and “you,” “your” or “yours” refer to you personally (i.e., the individual who reads and agrees to be bound by these Terms) and, if you access the Sites on behalf of a legal entity, to that entity. If you are using the Sites on behalf of any entity you represent and warrant that you are authorized to accept these Terms on such entity’s behalf and, by accepting these Terms, you are hereby binding such entity to the Terms.

Subject to your compliance with these Terms, solely for so long as you are permitted by Databricks to access and use the Sites, and provided that you keep intact all copyright and other proprietary notices, you may view Content and you may download and print the materials that Databricks specifically makes available for downloading from the Sites (such as white papers or user documentation), in each case solely for informational purposes and solely for personal or internal business use.

    ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS
    Databricks provides the Sites to you conditioned upon your accepting all of the Terms, without modification. Your use of the Sites constitutes your agreement with such Terms. We reserve the right to change, modify, add to, or remove portions of these Terms in our sole discretion at any time and we will, at our sole discretion, either post the modification on https://www.databricks.com/terms-of-use or provide you with email notice of the modification. You should check these Terms periodically for changes and you can determine when these Terms were last revised by referring to the “Last Updated” reference at the top of these Terms. Any modification shall be effective immediately upon the uploading of modified Terms. You indicate your agreement to comply with, and be bound by, any such modification by continuing to use or access the Sites after modified Terms are posted. If the modified Terms are not acceptable to you, your sole recourse is to discontinue your use of the Sites.

     

    If you have registered for and opened an account through the Sites (an “Account”), you are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account information, including your password, and for any and all activity that occurs under your Account. You agree to notify Databricks immediately of any unauthorized use of your Account or password, or any other breach of security. However, you will remain responsible for losses incurred by Databricks or by any other party due to your knowingly or inadvertently permitting unauthorized use of your Account or your Account information. You may not use anyone else’s ID, password or account at any time unless we expressly pre-approve such use, or unless expressly permitted under a Services Agreement. Databricks cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with these obligations. Registration for any account is void where the user lacks the requisite eligibility for registration or if such registration is otherwise prohibited.

    Software (“Software”) or the Platform Services may be made available to you through the Sites. Your rights to access and use the Platform Services, including any Software will be subject to your agreement to the applicable Services Agreement governing your use of the Platform Services and to any terms and conditions of any applicable third party software license agreement (“Software License”) identified in the Software or on the web page providing access to the Software. You may not use any Software unless you agree to be bound by all terms and conditions of any applicable Software License. If there is a conflict between any Services Agreement and any Software License, the conflicting term of the Software License shall control but only to the extent necessary to eliminate the conflict.
    LICENSE GRANT AND PROPRIETARY RIGHTS
    Provided that you fully comply at all times with these Terms and any other policies or restrictions posted on or transmitted through the Sites, Databricks grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to access and use the Sites. Except as otherwise specifically noted in these Terms or on the Sites, the Software, Submissions (as later defined), and all other information, content, user interfaces, graphics, registered or unregistered trademarks, logos, images, artwork, videos, and documents, and the design, structure, selection, coordination, expression, “look and feel” and arrangement of such materials, made available through the Sites (collectively, the “Content”), regardless of its source or creation, is owned, controlled or licensed by or to Databricks, and is protected by trade dress, copyright, patent and trademark laws, and various other intellectual property rights and unfair competition laws, and Databricks reserves and retains all rights in and to such Content. Any reproduction, redistribution or other use or exploitation of Software in violation of any applicable Software License or in violation of any license granted under these Terms or, if applicable, under a Services Agreement, is expressly prohibited by law, and may result in civil and criminal penalties.

     

    “Apache” and “Spark” are trademarks of the Apache Software Foundation. Any other third party trademarks, service marks, logos, trade names or other proprietary designations, that are or may become present within the Sites, including within any Content, are the registered or unregistered trademarks of the respective parties.

    Except solely as necessary for you to access the Sites for the intended purpose pursuant to these Terms, you may not copy, collect, modify, create derivative works or uses of, translate, distribute, transmit, publish, re-publish, perform, display, post, download, upload, sublicense, transfer, dispose of, resell or sell the Content or any other part of the Services. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, these Terms do not grant to you any license to any intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights, including any implied licenses or licenses granted by estoppel or otherwise.
    INFORMATION SUBMITTED THROUGH OR TO OUR SITES
    At our sole discretion, you may be permitted to provide Submissions (as defined in the next sentence) to the Sites (e.g., through our forums). “Submissions” are defined to include: any messages, emails, text, graphics, code, questions, suggestions, comments, feedback, ideas, plans, notes, drawings, sample data, sound, images, video, original or creative materials, and other items or materials that you may provide to discussion forums, blogs, or other interactive features or areas of the Services where you or other users can create, post, transmit or store Content. Unless otherwise specifically agreed to by you and Databricks, by uploading, e-mailing, posting, publishing or otherwise transmitting any Submission, you hereby acknowledge that such Submission is non-confidential and you automatically grant (or warrant that the owner of such rights has expressly granted) to Databricks a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, non-exclusive, sub-licensable, fully paid-up and royalty-free license to use, make, have made, offer for sale, sell, copy, distribute, perform, display (whether publicly or otherwise), modify, adapt, publish, transmit and otherwise exploit such Submission, by means of any form, medium, or technology now known or later developed, and to grant to others rights to do any of the foregoing. In addition, you warrant that all so-called moral rights in such Submission have been waived.

     

    For each Submission, you represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary for you to grant the license granted in the prior paragraph, and that such Submission, and your provision thereof to and through the Sites, does not violate any privacy, publicity, contractual, intellectual property, or other right or rights of any person or entity or otherwise violate any applicable laws, rules or regulations. You acknowledge that Databricks may have ideas or materials already under consideration or development that are or may be similar to your Submissions and that you are not entitled to any form of compensation or reimbursement from Databricks in connection with your Submissions. You agree to be fully responsible for, and to pay any and all royalties, fees, damages, and any other monies owing any person or entity by reason of, any Submission you provide to the Sites. We reserve the right to terminate access to all or any part of the Sites for anyone we suspect to be an infringer of our or any third party’s intellectual property rights of any kind whatsoever.

    You agree that you will not, and will not allow or authorize any third party to, post Submissions containing:
        Anything that is or may be (a) threatening, harassing, degrading, abusive or hateful; (b) an incitement to violence, terrorism or other wrongdoing; (c) defamatory or libelous; (d) invasive of privacy rights; (e) fraudulent, deceptive, impersonating of any person or entity, or misrepresentative of your affiliation with any person or entity; (f) obscene, pornographic, indecent, grotesque or otherwise objectionable; or (g) protected by copyright, trademark, confidentiality obligations, or other proprietary or privacy right without the express prior written consent of the owner of such right.
        Any material, the posting or usage of which would give rise to criminal or civil liability, or cause violation of any rules or regulations, or that encourages conduct that constitutes a criminal offense.
        Any virus, worm, Trojan horse or other computer code, file, data or program that is harmful, disruptive, corrupted, or invasive, or may be or is intended to damage or hijack the operation of any hardware or software.
        Any information identifiable to a particular individual, including but not limited to addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, birthdates, Social Security numbers and other government-issued identification numbers, payment card and other financial account numbers or login credentials, and health information.
        Any unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional materials, junk mail, spam, chain letter, pyramid scheme, political campaign message, offering of an investment opportunity, or any other form of solicitation.
        Any material with respect to which you do not have all rights, power and authority necessary for its collection, use and processing, or where your use and provision to the Sites would breach any agreement between you and any third party.

    Databricks generally does not pre-screen or monitor Submissions (but reserves the right to do so) and does not control Submissions. Therefore, Databricks does not guarantee the accuracy, quality or appropriateness of Submissions and disclaims any responsibility for Submissions, including any liability for errors or omissions, or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of their use. However, Databricks reserves the right at its sole discretion to refuse, delete, screen or edit Submissions, provided that even if we do remove or alter any Submission, we shall have no obligation to stop our other uses of such Submission or any other Submission as permitted above. We have no obligation to store any of your Submissions. We have no responsibility or liability for the deletion or failure to store, transmit or receive your Submissions, nor do we have any responsibility for the security, privacy, storage or transmission of other communications originating with or involving your use of the Sites, except as may be expressly stated in these Terms or in the Privacy Policy. You are solely responsible for creating backup copies of and replacing any Submissions at your sole cost and expense. Our Privacy Policy governs your Submissions.

    By accepting these Terms, you agree to our collection, use, and disclosure of your information as described in the Privacy Policy. No one under age 18 may register for an Account or provide any personal information to Databricks or to the Sites. If we learn that we have collected personal information from or about anyone under age 18, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 18, please contact us at privacy@databricks.com with the subject “Child Data“.

    Databricks reserves the right to disclose any Submissions, and the circumstances surrounding their transmission, to any third party to operate the Sites, to protect Databricks or its suppliers or representatives, to protect users of the Sites, to comply with legal or regulatory obligations, to enforce these Terms, or for any other reason. Databricks is not responsible or liable for the conduct of, or your interactions with, any other users of the Sites (whether online or offline), or for any associated loss, damage, injury or harm. By using the Site, you may be exposed to Submissions that are offensive, indecent or objectionable and you agree that Databricks bears no liability for such exposure.

    DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES
    YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF THE SITES, INCLUDING ANY CONTENT, IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.

YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE DISCLAIMERS, LIMITATIONS, AND WAIVERS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 6 SHALL SURVIVE ANY EXPIRATION OR TERMINATION OF THESE TERMS OR YOUR USE OF THE SITES.
    LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
    YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE ENTIRE RISK ARISING OUT OF YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SITES AND CONTENT REMAINS WITH YOU. IN NO EVENT WILL DATABRICKS OR ANY OF ITS DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS OR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE, SYSTEM FAILURE OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES) ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SITES, AND ANY CONTENT, SERVICES OR PRODUCTS INCLUDED ON OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SITES, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, EQUITY OR OTHERWISE) AND EVEN IF WE ARE AWARE OF OR HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

     

    IN NO EVENT WILL OUR TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY TO YOU ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS, OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SITES, INCLUDING ANY CONTENT, OR FROM THE USE OF OR EXPOSURE TO ANY SUBMISSIONS, EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100.00). MULTIPLE CLAIMS WILL NOT EXPAND THIS LIMITATION.

Databricks reserves the right, however, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you and, in such case, you agree to cooperate with Databricks’ defense of such claim, and in no event may you agree to any settlement affecting Databricks without Databricks’ prior written consent.
    SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF ACCESS TO OUR SITES
    Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in these Terms, you agree that Databricks may, in its sole discretion and with or without prior notice, for any or no reason, suspend or terminate your access to any or all of the Sites and/or block your future access to any or all of the Sites, including without limitation for any of the following reasons: (a) if we determine that you have violated any provision, or the spirit, of these Terms, (b) in response to a request by a law enforcement or other government agency, (c) due to discontinuance or material modification of any of the Sites, or (d) due to unexpected technical issues or problems. Databricks shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to any part of the Sites. The rights and obligations of these Terms which by their nature should survive, shall so survive any termination of your use of the Sites.
    CONTACT
    Questions or comments about the Terms or about the Sites may be directed to Databricks at the email address legal@databricks.com. You may also email us at that address if you would like to report what you believe to be a violation of these Terms. However, please note that we do not accept any responsibility to maintain the confidentiality of any report of a violation you may submit to us, including your identity, nor do we commit to providing a personal reply to any report you submit, nor are we obligated to take action in response to your report.
    CLAIMS OF COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT
    Databricks respects the intellectual property rights of others and we request that the people who use the Sites do the same. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials available on the Sites infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send Databricks a notice requesting that we remove the material or block access to it. If you believe in good faith that someone has wrongly filed a notice of copyright infringement against you, you may send a counter-notice to Databricks under applicable provisions of the DMCA. Please note that substantial penalties under U.S. copyright law may be levied against any filer of a false counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA. See 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3), available at https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap5.html for details. Notices and counter-notices should be sent to:

     

    Attn: Legal Department/DMCA Copyright Agent
    Databricks, Inc.
    160 Spear Street, Suite 1300
    San Francisco, CA 94105
    legal@databricks.com
    (866) 330-0121

    You should note that if you knowingly misrepresent in your notification that the material or activity is infringing, you will be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by us or the alleged infringer as the result of our relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing. We encourage you to consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice.

    In accordance with the DMCA and other applicable law, Databricks may at our discretion limit access to the Sites and/or terminate the accounts of any users who infringe any intellectual property rights of others, whether or not there is any repeat infringement.
    GENERAL
    The Terms and the relationship between each user and Databricks shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions and each party shall submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in San Francisco, California. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Except to the extent a Services Agreement applies, these Terms, along with the Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and Databricks with respect to your use of the Sites and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral or written, between you and Databricks with respect to the Sites. If any provision of the Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms remain in full force and effect. A party may only waive its rights under these Terms by a written document executed by both parties. Databricks’ failure to insist on or enforce strict performance of these Terms shall not be construed as a waiver by Databricks of any provision or any right it has to enforce these Terms, nor shall any course of conduct between Databricks and you or any other party be deemed to modify any provision of these Terms. The headings of the sections of these Terms are for convenience of reference only and are not intended to restrict, affect or be of any weight in the interpretation or construction of the provisions of such sections.

     

    None of your rights or duties under these Terms may be transferred, assigned or delegated by you without our prior written consent, and any attempted transfer, assignment or delegation without such consent will be void and without effect. We may freely transfer, assign or delegate any of our rights or duties under these Terms. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective representatives, heirs, administrators, successors and permitted assigns. No provision of these Terms is intended for the benefit of any third party, and the parties do not intend that any provision should be enforceable by a third party. Our relationship is an independent contractor relationship, and neither these Terms nor any actions by either party may be interpreted as creating an agency or partnership relationship. Nothing in these Terms shall be construed to obligate Databricks to enter into or engage with you on any commercial transaction.

    If you are provided access to any Software, you acknowledge that such Software may be subject to regulation by local laws and United States government agencies which prohibit export or diversion of certain products or information about products to certain countries and certain persons. You represent and warrant that you will not export or re-export such Software in violation of these regulations.

    You acknowledge that your breach of any of the provisions of these Terms may cause immediate and irreparable harm to Databricks for which we may not have an adequate remedy in money damages. We will therefore be entitled to obtain an injunction against such breach from any court of competent jurisdiction immediately upon request and will be entitled to recover from you the costs incurred in seeking such an injunction. The availability or exercise of our right to obtain injunctive relief will not limit our right to seek or obtain any other remedy.

    You agree that we will not be liable for delays, failures, or inadequate performance of the Sites resulting from conditions outside of our reasonable control, including but not limited to natural disasters or other acts of God, failure of telecommunications networks or any other network or utility, threatened or actual acts of terrorism or war, riots, labor strikes, or governmental acts or orders.
