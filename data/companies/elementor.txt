Trademark Guidelines
Last Updated: January 2021

These Elementor Trademarks Usage Guidelines (these “Guidelines”) outline how we permit the use of Elementor’s trademarks, brandnames, tradenames, service marks, service names, domain names and logos (collectively, “Elementor Trademarks”).
We have developed these Guidelines with the following goals in mind: We wish to make it easy for anyone to use the Elementor Trademarks for Community-Oriented Efforts in a manner that helps to spread and improve Elementor.

For the sake of these guidelines, “Community-Oriented Effort”means a non-profit project or meetup, which is made to encourage the use of the Elementor or Software.

If you wish to use the Elementor name in a for-profit project, please contact us as specified below.

We wish to make it clear how Community Oriented Efforts can, or cannot, use the Elementor Trademarks.
We wish to prevent anyone from using the Elementor Trademarks in an unfair profit form and to trick or confuse people who are looking for resources officially released by Elementor.

You acknowledge and agree that we are the sole and exclusive owners of the Elementor Trademarks, and that we retain all intellectual property rights in and to the Elementor Trademarks and goodwill associated with Elementor Trademarks and any goodwill generated by your use of any Elementor Trademarks will inure to our exclusive benefit.

You shall at no time contest, challenge, encourage or aid third-parties in contesting the validity or ownership of any Elementor Trademarks or take any action in derogation of our rights therein, including, without limitation, applying to register any trademark, tradename or other designation that is confusingly similar in any way to the Elementor Trademarks.
Our License

IN PLAIN ENGLISH
If you have a community project, then it’s ok to use Elementor’s name as long as there is no suggestion that the project is affiliated with Elementor.

Subject to the terms and conditions hereunder, we grant to you a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, revocable license to use and display Elementor Trademarks, solely in accordance with these Guidelines and other written instructions provided by us from time to time, and solely as a part of a Community Oriented Effort.

The Elementor Trademarks shall not be displayed in a manner that implies that the project is affiliated with Elementor. This doesn’t just mean that to comply with these Guidelines; you can write, “we are not affiliated with Elementor” in your footer. Instead, you must refrain altogether from using misleading business practices such as using a domain name comprising solely of the word “Elementor” or just using our logo as your website’s logo.
Restrictions

IN PLAIN ENGLISH
Don’t make people think you’re affiliated with Elementor.

Your project must have discernible differences from Elementor’s Software. Meaning, it is not a redistribution of the Software.
Your use of the Elementor Trademarks is not displayed in a manner that implies that your project, products and/or services are endorsed or sponsored by Elementor.

For example, organizing an “Elementor Support Forum” might be confusing, and therefore we request that you state that your website is a “Support Forum For Elementor.”

Using the Elementor Trademarks’ colors as a part of your website’s branding is ok, but you shall not do so if this misleads people to think that the website is a formal Elementor site.
Any deceptive practices, such as using domain names that are meant to mislead people to think that they are using an official Elementor website, are prohibited.
Design

IN PLAIN ENGLISH
We have invested in branding. Don’t change it.
All use of Elementor Trademarks (including any goodwill arising therefrom) shall solely benefit Elementor.

We may process personal data on our Hosting Users’ behalf, if you are their visitor or user, please contact them directly with any requests.

With respect to our hosting offering, we may store personal data of visitors and users of our Users, who are hosting their website on Elementor (“Hosting Users”).

If you are a visitor or user of our Hosting Users’ website, and you would like to make any requests or queries regarding data we process on their behalf, please contact them directly. For example, if you are a visitor or user of our Hosting User and you wish to access, correct, or delete data processed by Elementor on their behalf, please direct your request to the relevant Hosting User (who is the “data controller” of such data – per Section 11 below). Note that if you do contact us, we may share your communications with the relevant Hosting User.

If you are a visitor or user of our Hosting Users’ website, we recommend reading such privacy policy carefully and making sure that you fully understand and agree to it. Please note that such Hosting Users’ websites are not governed by this Privacy Policy.
11. Roles and Responsibilities

IN PLAIN ENGLISH
We are the controllers of our Prospects and Users data; we are the processors of visitors and users’ data processed on our Hosting Users’ behalf.

Certain data protection laws and regulations, such as the GDPR or the CCPA typically distinguish between two main roles for parties processing personal data: the “data controller” (or under the CCPA, “business”), who determines the purposes and means of processing; and the “data processor” (or under the CCPA, “service provider”), who processes the data on behalf of the data controller. Below we explain how these roles apply to our Services, to the extent that such laws and regulations apply.

Elementor is the “data controller” of its Prospects and Users data. With respect to such data, we assume the responsibilities of data controller (solely to the extent applicable under law), as set forth in this Privacy Policy. In such instances, our Service Providers processing such data will assume the role of “data processor”.

Elementor is the “data processor” of its Hosting Users’ visitors and users’ data, which we process on behalf of our Hosting Users, who are the “data controller” of such data. Such processing will be in accordance with Elementor Hosting Data Processing Agreement (“DPA”). In these instances, our Service Providers processing such data will assume the role of “sub-processors”.

For the avoidance of doubt, each Hosting User is solely responsible for providing adequate notice to their visitors and users whose personal data may be processed – including sufficient reference to the processing of their personal data via the Services, and any other information necessary to comply with all applicable privacy and data protection laws; and to obtain all approvals and consents from such individuals as required under such laws.

External Links: while our Services may contain links to other websites or services, we are not responsible for their privacy practices. We encourage you to pay attention when you leave our Services for the website or application of such third-parties, and to read the privacy policies of each and every website and service you visit. This Privacy Policy applies only to our Services.Updates and Amendments: we may update and amend this Privacy Policy from time to time by posting an amended version on our Services. The amended version will be effective as of the date it is published. We will provide prior notice if we believe any substantial changes are involved via any of the communication means available to us or via Services. After such notice period, all amendments shall be deemed accepted by you.

Our Services are not designed to attract children under the age of 18: we do not knowingly collect personal data from children and do not wish to do so. If we learn that a person under the age of 18 is using the Services, we will attempt to prohibit and block such use and will make our best efforts to promptly delete any personal data stored with us with regard to such child. If you believe that we might have any such data, please contact us by e-mail at privacy@elementor.com.

California Requirements: This Privacy Policy describes the categories of personal information we may collect and the sources of such information (in Section ‎‎1 above), and our retention (Section ‎4) and deletion (Section ‎9) practices. We also included information about how we may process your information (in Sections ‎2 through ‎8), which includes for “business purposes” under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). We do not sell your personal information for the intents and purposes of CCPA. We may share personal data with third parties or allow them to collect personal data from our Services as described in Section ‎6 above, if those third parties are authorised Service Providers or business partners who have agreed to our contractual limitations as to their retention, use, and disclosure of such personal data, or if you integrate the services of third parties with our Services, or direct us to disclose your personal data to third parties.

If you have any questions or would like to exercise your rights under the CCPA, you can contact privacy@elementor.com. Questions, concerns or complaints: if you have any comments or questions regarding our Privacy Policy, or if you have any concerns regarding your personal data held with us, or if you wish to make a complaint about how your personal data is being processed by Elementor, you can contact us at privacy@elementor.com.

Static Hosting
Dynamic Content

When your website is in static mode, dynamic content features, such as user logins, commenting systems, e-commerce functionality, and live data feeds, may not work as expected or may be completely unavailable.
Database-Dependent Functionality

Many website features rely on databases to store and retrieve information. In static mode, where no database interactions are possible, functionality that depends on database queries may not work. This includes content management systems (CMS), dynamic page generation, search functionality, and data-driven applications.
Traffic

IN PLAIN ENGLISH
We may put a cap on traffic, and block certain traffic.

Your subscription offers limited bandwidth and traffic, and is not meant to serve as a content delivery network. We provide limited service, with service caps.

We may suspend any account, subscription or website if it deviates from our service cap, or collect a surcharge according to our then-applicable rates.

We moreover require that files hosted on the website will not be deep-linked, and that you will not use the website as a storage service.
We do not allow storage of files larger than a certain threshold, and if we believe a file is used as a part of a file sharing scheme, we may disable access to it.
Our Responsibilities

IN PLAIN ENGLISH
We provide limited hosted and technical support.

We provide the Hosting Service, including technical support, as described in each Offer Description. We may enhance and refine the Hosting Service provided we do not materially reduce its core functionality. From time to time, we may perform scheduled maintenance to update the servers and software used to provide the Hosting Service. You acknowledge that we may, in certain situations, need to perform emergency maintenance of the Hosting Service without providing advance notice to You, during which time, we may temporarily suspend Your access to and use of the Hosting Service.

We may provide you with support services using our access tokens that you will grant us via tools and software that are integrated in the service.
Service Level

IN PLAIN ENGLISH
We warrant that our Services will be operational most of the time.

We will make any effort to ensure that the Hosting Services are performed in a professional manner with industry standards reasonably applicable to such Services.

We strive for the hosting services to be operational at least 99.9% of the time calculated annually, i.e. that downtime percentage will be no more than 0.1%
Storing Third Party Code

IN PLAIN ENGLISH
We allow you to run some external plugins, but may refuse any plugin for any purpose.

We allow you to store and run third party code as long as it adheres to our Acceptable Use Policy in our Terms of Service, and as long as it does not create excessive server use and harms our user experience.

We may disable any third party code at any time and without prior notice.

We may also allow you to use some selected third party plugins using your hosted account. These plugins are neither endorsed by us nor affiliated with us, and we assume no responsibility for their functionality.

Our offering includes an installed WordPress website, with the Elementor plugins installed. However, in order to allow functionality, this also includes several first party and third-party code to provide services and collect data; the removal of such pre-installed software is prohibited, even if technically possible.

If you decide to upload, embed, display or otherwise make available to the public any third party content, you need to ensure that you have the right permission and license to do so and that such content does not harm any third party or is in violation of any law. We cannot inspect, nor do we assume responsibility, for such action.

Your Content

IN PLAIN ENGLISH
Our content policy applies; please read it. Don’t post illegal content, offensive content or other content that is in violation of any person’s rights.

The statements in our Submission Policy applies to all content in your website.

By using our Services you provide us with information, files, and folders that you submit to us (together, “your uploads”). You retain full ownership to your uploads. We do not claim any ownership to any of it. These Terms do not grant us any rights to your uploads or intellectual property except for the limited purpose of operating, promoting and improving our Services and to develop new ones.

We prohibit the use of software or scripts running on our servers that may cause the server to load beyond a reasonable level, as we may determine from time to time.

You also acknowledge and agree that we reserve the right to remove sites, temporarily or permanently, if you are in violation of these Terms or if your site’s content may deem as harassing, abusive, racist, offensive, deceptive, encouraging criminal or harmful conduct, libelous, incendiary, obscene or otherwise violates any third party’s rights.
Backups

IN PLAIN ENGLISH
Backups are a part of your plan, but you may not be able to use them. Back the material by yourself.

The amount of data that can be backed up under your subscription is limited to the amount specified in your chosen plan. Attempting to backup additional data beyond this limit may require you to agree to additional charges. We will use reasonable efforts to maintain and backup data, but we cannot guarantee that all data will be free from errors or corruption. We cannot warrant that we will be able to restore your website and content at all times. Therefore, it is your sole responsibility to create your own backups for your website. In addition, we reserve the right to limit or delete backups of your data if it is determined that your usage is consuming an excessive amount of system resources or causing performance issues of other users.

We reserve the right to delete any websites that have been in a staging status for a longer period of time than is mentioned in the plan you have chosen.

This policy is implemented to maintain the performance and security of our servers, and to ensure that inactive websites do not occupy valuable resources. We will not be responsible for any loss of data or content as a result of such deletion.
SSL Certificates

IN PLAIN ENGLISH
SSL is not super-secure, and our certificates are temporary.

We may offer SSL certificates for your websites, which are based on third party certificate service. Such certificates do not mean we inspected ownership of your website and domain-name, nor do they mean that we validated such a domain’s adherence with any practices.

Such certificates may be revoked at any time, either by us or by the third party provider, for any reason.
Domains

IN PLAIN ENGLISH
Respect others’ rights; only buy domains that you can legally use.

We may offer you to purchase domain names using our service, either by our own services or by a third party service. In such a case, your purchase of domain names will be in accordance with the applicable laws and policies, and shall not infringe on any third party’s rights or applicable state laws. We reserve the right to disconnect any domain from your subscription at any time, without notice, if we determine that the domain is being used in violation of these terms or for any other reason at our sole discretion. The number of domains that can be connected to your subscription is limited to the number specified in your chosen plan. Attempting to connect additional domains beyond this limit may require you to agree to additional charges.

IN PLAIN ENGLISH
Please add a Privacy Policy to your website; tell your users about our analytics services.

Our use of your data is subject to Data Processing Agreement and we may use third party sub-processors according to our published list, as updated from time to time.

Please ensure your visitors are aware of the location and processing methods and are given a full and complete list of subprocesses.
“Notes” Feature

IN PLAIN ENGLISH
Do not insert or upload any personal, confidential or important information into a note, when using the Notes feature. Site Admins have full access to view all notes on the site and their content, and provide access to Notes to any other site user. Therefore, We cannot guarantee privacy on notes’ content.

In order to use Notes, non-admins users must receive an invitation from an admin of your site. As we indulge you to use the Notes for its many advantages, please keep in mind that site admins have a full and exclusive control over notes created by using the Notes feature and therefore every action should be accordingly. We recommend not to insert or upload any kind of personal, confidential or important information into a note, when using the Notes feature. In addition, all notes’ information is stored on your site’s database and together with the admin’s control it gives you all the reasons to keep your personal and important information in more private and secure ways.

Non-admin users, who are granted personal permission by an admin to use the Notes feature, will have viewing access to all notes on the site (placed on posts they are allowed to view) and full control over notes created by them, as well as the ability to view the site’s full users list (as part of the Notes feature’s integral capability to mention other users in a note).
Termination

IN PLAIN ENGLISH

We may suspend the operation of this service at any time, and with or without prior notice.

We may provide a grace period following a breach of these terms or a non-payment; this period shall be at our sole discretion.

7. How we treat Do Not Track (DNT) signals
Various browsers allow a “do not track” (DNT) setting that relies on a technology known as a DNT header, which sends a signal to websites visited by the individual about the individual’s browser DNT setting. At this time, there is no general agreement on how companies like Elementor should interpret Do Not Track signals. Therefore, Elementor does not currently commit to respond to DNT signals, whether that signal is received on a computer or on a mobile device. Elementor does, however, provide meaningful choices to you about the information that is collected through cookies and web beacons through the various opt-out options set forth above. We will continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a standard.
Taxation
Last Updated: February 2023

All Fees are exclusive of all taxes, including value-added tax, sales tax, goods and services tax, etc., levies or duties imposed by taxing authorities, as applicable (“Taxes”) which shall be borne solely by you. If we are obligated to collect or pay Taxes for the Fees payable by you, such Taxes may be added to the payment of any outstanding Fees and will be reflected in the invoice for such transaction. We recommend that you verify the existence of any additional fees you may be charged by third parties in connection with the purchase of the Services or in connection with the renewal thereof (such as international transaction fees, currency exchange fees, or fees due to banks or credit card companies). We are not responsible for any such additional fees or costs.

DSA Regulation Compliance
Last updated: February 18, 2024

Elementor’s Commitment to a Safer Online Environment in Accordance with the DSA

The EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA) aims to foster a secure digital space where user rights are safeguarded, values that resonate deeply with Elementor. We are steadfast in our dedication to providing a secure and inclusive platform for our users.
Our Content Guidelines: Ensuring Safety, Equality, and Compliance

Elementor’s content principles are grounded in three key pillars:

    Encouraging Creativity: Elementor empowers individuals to freely express themselves and share varied content online through their websites.
    Prioritizing Safety: The safety and well-being of our users and their communities are paramount to us.
    Upholding Equality: We are committed to treating all users fairly and equally under our policies.

Content Moderation Measures

Aligned with the DSA’s Regulatory Framework, Elementor employs proactive measures to identify and address illegal content on our platform. We leverage automated tools and human review to maintain our content standards, including:

    Identifying Illegal Activities: Our systems diligently take action against activities such as Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM), phishing, fraud, terrorist financing, and the dissemination of fake news.
     “Report button”: Users of the platform and other individuals may report their concerns to us. As a company, we take each report seriously and shall address each one individually by conducting a compliance check and decide whether the content is DSA-compliant or not. We reserve the right to remove content which is one of the following but not limited to offensive, provoking or enabling criminal and/or terrorist activity.

Reactive Content Moderation Measures

In addition to proactive measures, Elementor implements reactive steps to address reported violations, such as:

    Accessible Reporting Channels: We provide easily accessible channels for users and law enforcement agencies to report potentially illegal or policy-violating content by contacting us at dsa@elementor.com
    Ongoing Moderator Training: Our moderators receive continuous training to effectively moderate content in accordance with our policies.

As to our hosting services, and following a complaint received via our report button, we may decide to remove certain websites or content based on our risk analysis, regulatory requirements like the DSA, and our own discretion. We’ll provide reasons for any removals, limitations, or blocks. .

As such, we undertake the responsibility to ensure that comprehensive AML proceedings and best practices are firmly in place. Our objective is to conduct customer identification processes with the utmost diligence and precision, adhering strictly to regulatory requirements and industry standards.

Our approach to AML compliance entails the following key principles:

Rigorous Customer Due Diligence (CDD) in case of an activated “report” button:
We will conduct thorough CDD measures to verify the identities of our customers, ensuring that we have a clear understanding of their backgrounds, activities, and potential risk profiles to the extent we are able to do so as a private company.

Enhanced Monitoring and Reporting:
We will implement enhanced monitoring systems to detect and flag any transactions or activities that appear suspicious or indicative of money laundering or terrorist financing. Our dedicated compliance team will closely monitor transactional patterns, account behaviors, and other relevant indicators to promptly identify and investigate any potential red flags.

Ongoing Training and Education:
We are committed to providing comprehensive training and education to our staff members, ensuring that they are equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to recognize and respond effectively to AML-related risks and obligations. This includes regular training sessions, updates on regulatory developments, and access to resources and guidance materials.

Collaboration with Authorities:
As required by law, we will maintain open channels of communication and collaboration with relevant authorities, including law enforcement agencies and regulatory bodies, to share information and report suspicious activities, and contribute to broader efforts to combat financial crime. We understand the importance of working together with external stakeholders to uphold the integrity of our platform and the financial system as a whole.

By adhering to these principles and implementing robust AML procedures, we are dedicated to ensuring the integrity and security of our platform, safeguarding against the misuse of our services for illicit financial purposes, and upholding our commitment to regulatory compliance under the DSA.
