7. Rules
‍
Your obligations to end users:
‍
Roles
Voiceflow is a “service provider” to you, and you are a “customer” of our Services irrespective of whether you pay fees to obtain the Services. Any natural persons accessing or using your Voiceflow created voice apps and other software created by you on our Services are deemed your “end users.” Voiceflow does not have a direct relationship with any of your end users, therefore Voiceflow is not responsible for how you handle end user information.
‍
Applicable laws
You may have additional obligations under local law other than those described in this Terms of Service. Such obligations may be more restrictive than this Terms of Service. Use of the Services does not ensure compliance with such laws, nor is Voiceflow responsible for your compliance with such laws.
‍
Security safeguards
You will use all reasonable efforts to protect information collected from end users via your use of the Services, including any personal information obtained from unauthorized access or use. In the event you discover that the end user information collected by you has been breached, compromised, or inadvertently exposed to non-authorized third parties, you shall notify Voiceflow promptly of such a breach or exposure including the root cause, remediation steps, and compensating controls to ensure such a breach does not occur in the future.

Privacy rights
‍You will respond to any end users wishing to exercise their privacy rights, under the applicable law, as it relates to any information collected via your use of the Services. For example, if end users located in certain jurisdictions may exercise a “right to be forgotten” (or “erasure”) to the information you have collected about them, you shall comply with their request as required by applicable law. For clarity, you are directly responsible (or, the “data controller”) for the information processed by your use of the Services, including any information processed via third-party applications available on the Services. Voiceflow is not a data controller to such information and is not responsible for responding to end users on your behalf.

Voiceflow may provide such notifications, whether the notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business-related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by Voiceflow in our sole discretion. Voiceflow reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification by contacting us at support@voiceflow.com . You agree that we may notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on the Service, and that your use of the Service after the effective date of the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated Terms.

The Updated Terms will be effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms, and will apply to your use of the Service from that point forward. The Terms of Service will govern any disputes arising before the effective date of the Updated Terms.
