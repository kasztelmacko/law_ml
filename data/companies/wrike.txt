3. IN-SERVICE ACTIVATIONS, FREE TRIALS, ORDERS, FEES, PAYMENT, AND FREE CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS

3.1. In-Service Activations. The Account Owner may activate Free Trial Services and purchase Service Subscriptions and Add-Ons to Customer's then-current Subscription (each, an "In-Service Activation") from within the Customer Account management portal. Customer agrees the Account Owner has the full legal authority to activate/purchase such In-Service Activations and to accept and bind Customer to any additional terms governing Customer's use of such In-Service Activations. Following activation/purchase of an In-Service Activation, Customer's continued use of any In-Service Activation shall be subject to its ongoing compliance with the Agreement and the applicable In-Service Activation terms of use

3.2. Free Trials. Customers are eligible to participate in a free trial of certain Service Subscriptions and Add-Ons (each, a “Free Trial Service”). Free Trial Services are not part of the Service, are not warranted or supported by Wrike, and are not subject to the terms of any separate agreement for the Service between Wrike and Customer. In no event shall Wrike be responsible for any processing, disclosure, modification, or deletion of Customer Data in connection with Customer’s use of Free Trial Services. A Free Trial Service begins when a new customer creates a Customer Account or when Customer orders the Free Trial Service, e.g., by the Account Owner activating the Free Trial Service from the Customer Account management portal, and, in each instance, ends upon the earlier of (i) the end of the free trial period for which Customer agreed to use such Free Trial Service; (ii) Customer converting the Free Trial Service into a paid-for Service Subscription and/or Add-On (“Converted Paid-For Service”), e.g., by the Account Owner clicking a “Subscription” button within the Customer Account management portal, following which, Customer’s continued use of the Converted Paid-For Service shall be subject to Customer’s ongoing compliance with the Agreement, and any free trial terms and conditions shall no longer apply to the converted Free Trial Service; and (iii) termination of the Free Trial Service by Wrike in its sole discretion. A free trial period may be extended upon mutual agreement by Wrike and Customer. During the free trial period, certain Service features may not be available. Customer can view the specific details of its Service plan by referencing the "Account Management - Subscription" page, available after logging into the Service. Customer may not receive notice or confirmation from Wrike that a Free Trial Service has ended or that a Converted Paid-For Service has begun.

3.2. General Terms and Billing. Wrike will bill and Customer agrees to pay Fees at the beginning and upon renewal of its Subscription, plus any applicable Taxes, unless and until Customer timely cancels its Subscription or Wrike terminates it. The Subscription will automatically renew for successive Subscription Terms at Wrike’s then-current rates unless Customer provides written notice of its intent not to renew such Subscription prior to the expiration of the then-current Subscription Term. Customer must cancel its Subscription before the Subscription renews to avoid incurring the next Subscription Term’s Fees. Fees may include Service-level changes as requested by Customer. Customer authorizes Wrike to automatically bill Customer for each renewal period on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of the renewed Subscription. If Customer elects to upgrade its Service level or to purchase Add-Ons, Wrike will prorate the amount due based on the number of days remaining in Customer’s billing cycle; provided, however, that any such proration shall be based on Customer’s Service level or Add-Ons in existence immediately prior to Customer’s election to upgrade its Service level or purchase Add-Ons. If Customer downgrades its Service level, Customer may cause the loss of Customer Data or Add-ons for its Customer Account. Customer agrees Wrike shall not be liable for any such losses. Except to the extent required by applicable law (including, without limitation, Australian law), all purchases are final and WRIKE DOES NOT PROVIDE REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR ANY PARTIAL OR UNUSED SUBSCRIPTION PERIODS, OR WHERE CUSTOMER HAS ELECTED TO DOWNGRADE ITS SERVICE LEVEL OR OTHERWISE REMOVED ANY PAID ADD-ON, OR FOR ANY FEATURE OR COMPONENT OF THE SERVICE THAT CUSTOMER HAS PAID FOR, BUT NOT USED.

3.3. Fee Increase Grace Period. Wrike may, in its sole discretion, offer a grace period during which Customer’s Fees will not increase for a certain period of time. If Customer does not accept the increase or addition to the existing Fees, Customer may elect to terminate its Subscription during the then-current billing period and Customer shall not be liable for such Fee increase after the applicable billing period; however, any later renewal of the Subscription at Wrike’s then-current rates may be subject to the increased Fees. If Customer’s credit or debit card used to pay the Fees reaches its expiration date, Customer’s continued use of the Service constitutes its authorization for Wrike to continue billing Customer, and Customer remains responsible for any uncollected amounts.

3.4. Free Customer Accounts. Customer may cancel a paid-for Subscription at any time and cancellation will be effective immediately. Customer agrees that, after termination or expiration of its Subscriptions, its Customer Account may be immediately deactivated, together with any active Subscriptions associated with the Customer Account, or the Customer Account may be converted to a Free Customer Account (if available for the particular terminated or expired Subscriptions). Customer may not be able, or may have limited ability, to export Customer Data after deactivation of its Customer Account or conversion to a Free Customer Account and it is Customer’s sole liability to export the Customer Data from its Customer Account prior to cancelation, expiration, or termination of its paid-for Subscriptions or the Agreement.

3.5. Taxes. In connection with the purchase and/or use of the Service, Customer may be subject to Taxes, by any authority which has jurisdiction to impose such Taxes. Customer agrees that Customer is solely responsible for its obligation and payment of any such Taxes, and Customer agrees, unless otherwise required by applicable law, to indemnify Wrike to the extent that Wrike incurs any obligations or other liabilities in connection with such Taxes. Wrike’s failure to charge appropriate Taxes due to incomplete or incorrect information provided by Customer will not relieve Customer of its obligations under this Section 3.5.

3.6. Payment Fees. If Customer makes any payment via credit card, foreign currency, or wire transfer, all associated credit card fees, currency exchange fees, and outgoing and incoming bank fees (including, without limitation, Customer’s bank fees and Wrike’s bank fees) (collectively with credit card fees and currency exchange fees, “Payment Fees”) shall be Customer’s responsibility and shall be recoverable by Wrike from Customer. Customer may include such Payment Fees at the time of the payment to Wrike. However, if such Payment Fees are not included by Customer at the time of payment to Wrike, then Wrike shall be entitled to full reimbursement of such Payment Fees from Customer within sixty (60) days of any applicable payment initiated by Customer.
4. TERM AND TERMINATION

4.1. Term. The Agreement commences on the Effective Date and will remain in effect until expiration or termination of all paid-for Subscriptions and completion of any consulting services, or as otherwise expressly stated herein. Any Order hereunder remains governed by the Agreement for its then-current Subscription Term and/or completion of any consulting services, irrespective of any earlier expiration or termination of the Agreement. Expiration or termination of the Agreement does not automatically terminate any applicable Orders.

4.2. Termination. Wrike may, with or without prior notice, immediately terminate the Agreement, Customer’s Account, Subscriptions and/or corresponding Subscription Term, and/or access to the Service and/or Add-Ons. Such termination may be made in Wrike's sole and absolute discretion, with or without cause.

Customer will be liable for losses, damages, liability, expenses, and attorneys’ fees incurred by Wrike or a third party due to someone other than a User using a Customer Account. Ownership of a Customer Account is directly linked to the individual or entity that completes the registration process for such Customer Account. Customer acknowledges that Wrike will rely on the information provided by Customer to resolve issues arising with the Customer Account.

5.3. Customer Account Access/Instructions. The Account Owner and any authorized Users will have access to information in the Customer Account, subject to sharing settings of the Customer Account. Wrike will not provide access to a Customer Account to any person or entity other than Account Owner during initial provisioning of the Service at any time, except with the Account Owner’s prior consent. Customer agrees that Wrike may rely on instructions given by the Account Owner either through the Customer Account management portal or via email from the address on file at Wrike for the Account Owner. Customer agrees not to request access to or information about an account that is not owned by the Customer. In the event of a dispute regarding Customer Account data, Wrike will only release information to persons other than the Account Owner pursuant to a court order or other notarized waiver and release as determined by Wrike. Customer is solely liable and responsible for understanding the settings, privileges, and controls for the Service and for controlling whom Customer permits to become a User and the settings and privileges for such User, including, without limitation, the right for a User to invite other Users (either paid or unpaid) to use Customer’s Service, the right to incur charges on the Customer Account, and the right to access, modify or share tasks or projects, etc. Customer is responsible for the activities of all of its Users, including orders they may place and how Users use the Customer Data, even if those Users are not from Customer’s organization or domain.

To the extent a Third Party Service accesses Customer Data, the processing of Customer Data once transferred to and within the Third Party Service shall be governed solely by the terms, if any, of the Third Party Service provider and in no event will Wrike be responsible for any use, disclosure, modification, or deletion of such Customer Data, or for any act or omission by such Third Party Service provider or its services, once transferred to and within the Third Party Service. Customer’s use of such Third Party Services is solely the responsibility of Customer and the Third Party Service provider.

8.6. Aggregated Anonymous Data. Wrike may aggregate the metadata and usage data of Customer and/or Users collected or otherwise made available through the Service so that the results are non-personally identifiable with respect to Customer or Users (“Aggregated Anonymous Data”). The Aggregated Anonymous Data will be deemed Wrike’s proprietary technology, and Customer acknowledges that Wrike may use the Aggregated Anonymous Data, both during and after the Term; (i) for its own internal, statistical analysis; (ii) to develop and improve the Service; and (iii) to create and distribute reports and other materials regarding use of the Service. For purposes of clarity, nothing in this Section 8.6 gives Wrike the right (or ability) to publicly identify Customer or any User as the source of any Aggregated Anonymous Data.

8.7. Security and Privacy. When providing the Service and Wrike Materials, Wrike will (i) implement and maintain the administrative, organizational, and technical security controls at least as protective as the terms set forth in the Wrike Information Security Addendum available at https://www.wrike.com/legal/enterprise-winfosec/; and (ii) process personal data on Customer’s behalf as set forth in the Wrike Data Processing Addendum available at https://www.wrike.com/legal/trust-center/, as may in each case be amended from time to time without notice.

Customer’s use of Wrike AI does not grant Wrike any right or license to use Customer Data in a manner that is inconsistent with the Agreement or to train Wrike’s machine learning methods or data models unless otherwise agreed to by Customer. Wrike AI and its machine learning methods and data models may develop over time to better address specific use cases. To improve Wrike AI and its underlying data models, Wrike may use (i) usage data and metadata, including Anonymous Aggregated Data, collected from Customer’s use of Wrike AI; (ii) Feedback provided by Customer or its Users to Wrike, such as by labeling Wrike AI Output with a “thumbs up” or “thumbs down;” and (iii) information Customer gives Wrike its express permission to use for such purposes.

8.15. Feedback. If Customer provides any comments, suggestions, possible improvements, or other feedback to Wrike regarding the Service or consulting services related to the Agreement (“Feedback”), Wrike may use such Feedback for any purpose without any compensation or obligation to Customer provided such use does not violate Wrike’s confidentiality obligations under the Agreement. Customer grants Wrike an irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable, and perpetual license to use, modify, publish, and distribute such Feedback, as well as to make, have made, distribute, sell, offer to sell, display perform and otherwise exploit products and services that use such Feedback for any purpose without restriction.

8.16. Relationship of the Parties. The Parties are independent contractors and nothing in the Agreement creates a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary, or employment relationship between or among the Parties. Wrike may subcontract responsibilities under the Agreement but remains responsible for its breach of the Agreement by the acts or omissions of Wrike or its subcontractors. No person or entity not a Party to the Agreement will be deemed to be a third-party beneficiary of the Agreement or any provision hereof.

8.17. Eligibility and Scope. To use the Service, Customer represents and warrants that Customer is competent to enter into the Agreement and that Customer and its Users are each at least 18 years of age. If the laws where Customer or its Users reside require that Customer or its Users be older for Wrike to lawfully provide the Service to them and use their personal data without parental consent, then Customer or its Users must be that older age. If the representations and warranties above in this Section 8.17 are not true, or if Wrike has previously prohibited Customer or its Users from accessing or using the Service, Customer or such Users may not access or use the Service.

8.18. Assignment. Customer may not assign its rights or delegate its duties under the Agreement either in whole or in part without Wrike’s prior written consent, except that Customer may assign the Agreement in whole to one of Customer’s Affiliates, or to a successor in interest as part of a corporate reorganization, consolidation, merger, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets. Customer shall promptly provide notice to Wrike including documentation sufficient to evidence completion of any permitted assignment. Any attempted assignment in violation of the foregoing shall be void. The Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each Party and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

A copy of all legal notices from Customer to Wrike must also be sent to the email address legal@team.wrike.com.

8.22. Entire Agreement; Order of Precedence. The Agreement sets forth the entire agreement and understanding of the Parties relating to the Service and Customer Data and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous oral and written agreements. For any conflict between the terms of the Agreement and any supplementary BAA terms related to PHI, the Agreement shall control. Nothing contained in any other document submitted by Customer shall in any way add to or otherwise modify the Agreement or any Wrike license program terms under which an Order is submitted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a conflict between the Agreement and a Wrike Order Form, the Wrike Order Form shall control. 

8.23. Modifications. Wrike may update or make changes to the Terms of Service from time to time for valid reasons, such as adding new functions or features to the Service, technical adjustments, corrections of typographical or other errors, for legal or regulatory reasons or for any other reasons as Wrike deems necessary, at its sole discretion, without notice. The modified Terms of Service will be published at https://www.wrike.com/terms/ and will be identified by the last updated date. Customer’s continued access to and use of the Service after publication constitutes acceptance by Customer of the then-current modified Terms of Service. When material changes to the Terms of Service are made, Wrike will provide Customer with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice to the Account Owner within the Service or by sending Customer an email. Customer’s continued access to and use of the Service after such notice will constitute Customer’s acceptance of the then-current modified Terms of Service. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any modified Terms of Service published: (i) on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of a renewed Subscription; or (ii) upon activation/purchase of an In-Service Activation shall then apply and legally bind the Parties.

8.24. Miscellaneous Terms. Captions and headings are used herein for convenience only, are not a part of the Agreement, and shall not be used in interpreting or construing the Agreement.

Wrike’s resellers and distributors do not have the right to make modifications to the Agreement or to make any additional representations, commitments, or warranties binding on Wrike, its Affiliates, or its subcontractors. Wrike’s failure to enforce any term of the Agreement will not be construed as a waiver of the right to enforce any such terms in the future. Unless otherwise specified, remedies are cumulative. The Agreement is agreed to through purchase (including automatic renewals) and/or use of the Service.

8.25. Choice of Law and Disputes. The Agreement and any disputes arising out of or related hereto shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to its conflicts of laws rules, the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods, or the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act.
